# DataKey
This is my first project. I'm working on a security system that aims to little companies that can't afford Systems like fingerprint, face recognition, etc.
It works with a Random Generated KeyPass and a SQL Server DataBase. When a Master or a Guard is sure about your information and confirm that you are part of the DataBase. 
Them can generate your own KeyPass for entering the system.
